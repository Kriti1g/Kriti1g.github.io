    <h2>Reflecting on Group Participation:</h2>
    <p>Working in a group for this assessment presented some challenges, as not everyone was actively participating and adhering to the agreed-upon responsibilities. Patience became a key virtue, given the time it took to make progress, especially when many aspects of the project were beyond our control. Despite these obstacles, we managed to work together effectively, as revealed in our final grades.</p>
    <h2>Limitations </h2>
    <p>However, the creation of the actual multimodal was a bit rushed as made evident in the feedback provided, some slides lacked visual components. One notable instance was when we had to wait for over three days for a group member to respond, causing difficulties in time management and ultimately resulting in a rushed final product. As revealed in the feedback provided:

       If given a rerun; I would limit the texts on the slides and include more animations and transitions to other slides to engage our target audience.

    <h2>Management Strategies </h2>
    <p>To manage our group effectively, we implemented several strategies. We established clear timeframes and regularly checked in on Zoom to monitor progress. (Refer to the image below) As the person responsible for submitting the final work, I undertook the role of overseeing the team and ensuring we stuck to our agreed-upon timelines. This approach helped us maintain a structured plan and allowed us time for necessary revisions.</p>
    <h2>Communication Styles and Conflict Resolution</h2>
    <p>In terms of communication styles, we initially used a passive approach to avoid being too harsh on team members. However, we soon realised that this style was ineffective. It became evident that direct communication would have been more efficient in ensuring the project's timely and thorough completion, with less stress. As our deadline neared and we faced potential time constraints, we resorted to a more assertive, albeit respectful, communication style. When individual attempts to contact the unresponsive group member failed, we collectively took a more direct and assertive approach, in which we got the desired response and allowed us to overcome our challenges. In the future to ensure effective group work, we would need to ensure there is enough time and space, communicate, monitor progress and stick to deadlines to enhance the overall quality of our assignment.</p>
